# Chapter 13: The `diff` Lib — LCS Line Diff, Edit Distance, Unified Diff, and Patching

## 13.1. Why Does the `diff` Lib Exist? (The Real-World Problem & Ridgun Philosophy)

> *"Why do I need a `diff` lib written from scratch in pure Ridgun instead of just linking a legacy C library?"*

That is the first question every systems engineer asks when meeting `diff`. And the answer captures the entire philosophy of `ridgun-libs`:

Let's be honest: when a test fails or a config file changes, a raw 200-line `"expected A, got B"` dump forces you to squint at the screen hunting for the exact line that changed.

The **`diff`** lib computes the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** over a 2D `Tensor[Int]` DP table to produce minimal edit scripts (`DiffKeep`, `DiffAdd`, `DiffDel`), edit distance, **Unified Diff** output (`---`/`+++`/`@@`), and lossless patching (`diff apply`).

In a traditional ecosystem, solving **`DIFF`** tasks means pulling in external C dependencies, wrestling with raw pointers, opaque type conversions, unchecked exceptions, or unpredictable garbage-collector pauses. In Ridgun, the **`diff`** lib (`src/main/ridgun/lib/diff.rg`) tackles the problem with four non-negotiable principles:

1. **Declare `import diff` (or `import diff as alias`) at the top of your file**: every lib defines its `module :: diff` namespace, and under `--strict` multi-word functions are always called with natural spaces.
2. **Chain your data pipelines left-to-right with `->`**: write `input step one -> step two -> result`, use `(+ _ _ +)` sequence masks to destructure tuples/lists, and omit `_ =` on sequential statements (or discard with `-> ()`).
3. **Tail-Call Optimization (TCO)**: all internal loops in `diff` are tail-recursive and compile into native hardware loops using $O(1)$ stack space.
4. **Deterministic Memory (`RMM1` / `RMM2`)**: every intermediate allocation is reclaimed at the exact instruction where its last read finishes, with no Garbage Collector.

## 13.2. Native Artifacts, Imports, and Complete `diff` API Catalog

In `ridgun-libs`, **`diff`** is a first-class **lib** located at `src/main/ridgun/lib/diff.rg` (domain `DIFF`). When built with `stable bundle`, it compiles into three native artifacts:

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Ridgun Bundle** | `target/bundles/diff.rglib` | Portable distribution and direct `import diff` resolution |
| **Compiled Archive** | `target/diff.rgc` | Type-checked intermediate artifact verified by `ridgunc` |
| **ELF64 Shared Object** | `target/libdiff.so` | Native dynamic shared library with zero C or `libc` dependencies |

> Every lib declares its own namespace via `module :: diff`: simply write `import diff` (or `import diff as alias`) at the top and call its functions with natural spaces (`my fn x`) and left-to-right `->` pipelines (`x my fn -> result`).

### 13.2.1. Summary of `diff` Functional Families

| Signature / Function / Type | Purpose & Usage |
|---|---|
| `type DiffOp` | `DiffKeep String | DiffDel String | DiffAdd String` |
| `diff lines / diff text` | Compute minimal LCS edit script between `[String]` lists or multiline strings |
| `diff edit distance / diff stats` | Minimal insertion+deletion distance and `(kept, added, deleted)` counts |
| `diff format / diff unified` | Render compact `+ / - /  ` lines or standard Unified Diff with headers |
| `diff apply / diff apply text` | Reconstruct the target document losslessly from an edit script |

## 13.3. Deep Dive into `diff`: Step-by-Step Examples for Every Feature

A signature table alone is never enough: let's explore **every capability** of the `diff` lib through progressive, runnable Ridgun examples. We will start with two everyday tabular recipes and then walk through every functional scenario, transformation, and boundary condition verified in `src/test/ridgun/test diff.rg`.

### 13.3.1. Example 1: Core Tabular Workflow with `diff`

Notice how in Ridgun the `=` signs and transformation steps using `diff` align into a clean, scannable table without unnecessary mutable variables or hidden side effects:

```ridgun
import diff

fn :: auditar cambio String String => Int String
      auditar cambio antes despues =
        diff edit distance antes despues -> dist
        diff unified antes despues "config.old" "config.new" -> parche
        (dist, parche)
```

### 13.3.2. Example 2: Safe Composition and Boundary Handling

Every function in the `diff` lib is designed to compose cleanly with boolean guards `|` and with the rest of the 32 libs in `ridgun-libs`:

```ridgun
import diff

fn :: verificar parche String [DiffEdit] => String
      verificar parche orig ops =
        diff apply orig ops
```

### 13.3.3. Example 3: Comparing Empty and Identical Texts: Zero Edit Distance and Invariant Verification

In this hands-on walkthrough we thoroughly exercise how `diff` behaves across this functional area, covering standard inputs, parameter combinations, and corner cases:

```ridgun
fn :: test_diff_empty_and_identical => ()
      test_diff_empty_and_identical =
        nl = char from code 10
        e_empty = diff text "" ""
        assert int equals (count_edits e_empty) 0 "AC1: empty diff edit count"
        assert false (diff has changes e_empty) "AC1: empty diff has no changes"
        assert int equals (diff edit distance "" "") 0 "AC1: empty edit distance"
        assert str eq (diff apply e_empty) "" "AC3: empty diff apply"
        same_doc = "alpha" + nl + "beta" + nl + "gamma"
        e_same = diff text same_doc same_doc
        assert int equals (count_edits e_same) 3 "AC1: identical 3-line count"
        assert false (diff has changes e_same) "AC1: identical has no changes"
        st_same = diff stats e_same
        assert int equals (equal_count st_same) 3 "AC1: equal_count == 3"
        assert int equals (insert_count st_same) 0 "AC1: insert_count == 0"
        assert int equals (delete_count st_same) 0 "AC1: delete_count == 0"
        assert int equals (diff edit distance same_doc same_doc) 0 "AC1: identical edit distance == 0"
        assert str eq (diff apply e_same) same_doc "AC3: identical diff apply"
        ()
```

        e_ins = diff text "" target
        assert true (diff has changes e_ins) "AC1: pure insert has changes"
        st_ins = diff stats e_ins
        assert int equals (equal_count st_ins) 0 "AC1: pure insert equal_count"
        assert int equals (insert_count st_ins) 3 "AC1: pure insert insert_count"
        assert int equals (delete_count st_ins) 0 "AC1: pure insert delete_count"
        assert int equals (diff edit distance "" target) 3 "AC1: pure insert edit distance"
        assert str eq (diff apply e_ins) target "AC3: pure insert apply"
        ins0 = nth_edit e_ins 0
        ins2 = nth_edit e_ins 2
        assert str eq (diff_op ins0) "insert" "AC1: ins0 op"
        assert int equals (old_line_no ins0) 0 "AC1: ins0 old_line_no"
        assert int equals (new_line_no ins0) 1 "AC1: ins0 new_line_no"
        assert int equals (new_line_no ins2) 3 "AC1: ins2 new_line_no"
        e_del = diff text target ""
        assert true (diff has changes e_del) "AC1: pure delete has changes"
        st_del = diff stats e_del
        assert int equals (equal_count st_del) 0 "AC1: pure delete equal_count"
        assert int equals (insert_count st_del) 0 "AC1: pure delete insert_count"
        assert int equals (delete_count st_del) 3 "AC1: pure delete delete_count"
        assert int equals (diff edit distance target "") 3 "AC1: pure delete edit distance"
        assert str eq (diff apply e_del) "" "AC3: pure delete apply"
        del0 = nth_edit e_del 0
        del2 = nth_edit e_del 2
        assert str eq (diff_op del0) "delete" "AC1: del0 op"
        assert int equals (old_line_no del0) 1 "AC1: del0 old_line_no"
        assert int equals (new_line_no del0) 0 "AC1: del0 new_line_no"
        assert int equals (old_line_no del2) 3 "AC1: del2 old_line_no"
        ()
```

        nl = char from code 10
        old_lines = ["A", "B", "C", "A", "B", "B", "A"]
        new_lines = ["C", "B", "A", "B", "A", "C"]
        edits = diff lines old_lines new_lines
        st = diff stats edits
        assert int equals (equal_count st) 4 "AC1: Myers LCS length 4"
        assert int equals (delete_count st) 3 "AC1: Myers delete count 3"
        assert int equals (insert_count st) 2 "AC1: Myers insert count 2"
        old_s = "A" + nl + "B" + nl + "C" + nl + "A" + nl + "B" + nl + "B" + nl + "A"

## 13.4. Under the Hood: How `diff` Is Built in Pure Ridgun (`src/main/ridgun/lib/diff.rg`)

One of the biggest advantages of `ridgun-libs` is that **there are no C black boxes**. You can open `src/main/ridgun/lib/diff.rg` and read exactly how every operation is implemented using pattern matching, `|` / `|.` guard trees, and tail-call optimization (TCO). Let's inspect the key building blocks of its real implementation:

### 13.4.1. Internal Implementation: Internal Helpers

Observe how `diff.rg` declares explicit `fn :: ... => ...` contracts first and resolves each case through aligned equations and tail calls:

      df list length [] = 0
      df list length (_:xs) = 1 + (df list length xs)
```

### 13.4.2. Internal Implementation: Public API

Observe how `diff.rg` declares explicit `fn :: ... => ...` contracts first and resolves each case through aligned equations and tail calls:

```ridgun
fn :: diff lines [String] [String] => [DiffEdit]
      diff lines old_lines new_lines =
        old_lines df rev [] -> rev_old
        new_lines df rev [] -> rev_new
        df zeros ((df list length new_lines) + 1) [] -> zero_row
        df build dp rev_old rev_new [zero_row] -> dp_rows
        df backtrack old_lines new_lines dp_rows 0 1 1 []

fn :: diff text String String => [DiffEdit]
      diff text old_s new_s = diff lines (df split lines old_s) (df split lines new_s)

fn :: df stats loop [DiffEdit] Int Int Int => DiffStats
      df stats loop [] eq ins del = DiffStats eq ins del
      df stats loop (e:es) eq ins del =
        | (diff_op e) == "equal" = df stats loop es (eq + 1) ins del
        | (diff_op e) == "insert" = df stats loop es eq (ins + 1) del
        | otherwise = df stats loop es eq ins (del + 1)

fn :: diff stats [DiffEdit] => DiffStats
      diff stats edits = df stats loop edits 0 0 0

fn :: diff edit distance String String => Int
      diff edit distance old_s new_s =
        diff text old_s new_s -> diff stats -> st
        (insert_count st) + (delete_count st)

fn :: diff has changes [DiffEdit] => Bool
      diff has changes [] = False
      diff has changes (e:es) =
        | (diff_op e) == "equal" = diff has changes es
        | otherwise = True

fn :: df format unified lines [DiffEdit] String => String
      df format unified lines [] acc = acc
      df format unified lines (e:es) acc =
        | (diff_op e) == "equal" = df format unified lines es (acc + " " + (line_text e) + (char from code 10))
        | (diff_op e) == "delete" = df format unified lines es (acc + "-" + (line_text e) + (char from code 10))
        | otherwise = df format unified lines es (acc + "+" + (line_text e) + (char from code 10))

fn :: df hunk start Int => Int
      df hunk start cnt =
        | cnt == 0 = 0
        | otherwise = 1

fn :: df unified header String String Int Int => String
      df unified header old_label new_label old_cnt new_cnt =
        old_cnt df hunk start -> old_start
        new_cnt df hunk start -> new_start
        char from code 10 -> nl
        "--- " + old_label + nl + "+++ " + new_label + nl + "@@ -" + (df int to str old_start) + "," + (df int to str old_cnt) + " +" + (df int to str new_start) + "," + (df int to str new_cnt) + " @@" + nl

fn :: diff unified String String String String => String
      diff unified old_label new_label old_s new_s =
        diff text old_s new_s -> edits
        edits diff stats -> st
        (equal_count st) + (delete_count st) -> old_cnt
        (equal_count st) + (insert_count st) -> new_cnt
        df unified header old_label new_label old_cnt new_cnt -> hdr
        df format unified lines edits hdr

fn :: df apply collect [DiffEdit] [String] => [String]
      df apply collect [] acc = df rev acc []
      df apply collect (e:es) acc =
        | (diff_op e) == "delete" = df apply collect es acc
        | otherwise = df apply collect es ([line_text e] :: acc)

fn :: df join lines [String] => String
      df join lines [] = ""
      df join lines (x:[]) = x
      df join lines (x:xs) = x + (char from code 10) + (df join lines xs)

fn :: diff apply [DiffEdit] => String
      diff apply edits = df join lines (df apply collect edits [])

## 13.5. Algorithmic Guarantees, `RMM1`/`RMM2` Memory, and the 5 Golden Rules of `diff`

- **Algorithmic & Safety Guarantee**: Guaranteed mathematical identity $diff\_edit\_distance(a, b) == |a| + |b| - 2 \cdot LCS(a, b)$ and lossless reconstruction `diff apply (diff lines a b) == b`.
- **$O(1)$ Stack Complexity via TCO**: Every recursive loop in `src/main/ridgun/lib/diff.rg` is in tail position, so `ridgunc` compiles them into native jumps with zero stack growth.
- **Deterministic Memory (`RMM1`/`RMM2`)**: Zero garbage-collector pauses; all intermediate allocations are reclaimed deterministically on scope exit.
- **Continuous Verification**: Statically checked via `stable check` and tested by the automated suite in `src/test/ridgun/test diff.rg`.

### The 5 Golden Rules When Programming with `diff`

1. **Declare `import diff` at the top of your file** and take advantage of space/underscore equivalence so your code reads like natural prose.
2. **Align your data pipelines with `=`**: chain `diff` calls into named intermediate steps and let `stable format` align the columns.
3. **Leverage `diff`'s total functions inside `|` guards**: inspect return values or unwrap ADTs via pattern matching rather than assuming external input is valid.
4. **Avoid cloning large structures when only reading**: remember that under `RMM2`, function input arguments incur zero reference-count overhead (`+0` / `-0`).
5. **Pair `diff` with `test` (`import test`)**: always lock in your domain invariants with `assert equals` or `assert true`.
